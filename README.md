# Prime Number Checker

This program checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

2. Enter a number in the provided input field.
3. Click the "ok" button.
4. The program will display a message indicating whether the number is prime or not.

## How It Works

The program uses a loop to check divisibility of the number by numbers from 2 to half of the number. If any of these numbers divide the input number without a remainder, then the number is not prime. Otherwise, it is considered prime.
